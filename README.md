# Collection

Repository to-do:
 Front page: Finished Initial grid layout
   - Take-aways:
    - max-width and max-height do not work together when vw, vh (why?)
    - vw and vh + border = scroll (unless max dimensions are set)
    - do not confuse vw and vh
    - after styling, make sure to include the element as well (define && declare!)
  
  
Projects in progress:
  - 100 blocks generator
  - Automated packing list
