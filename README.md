# Collection

##Repository to-do:
 Front page:
 [*] Finished Initial grid layout
   * Take-aways:
     * max-width and max-height do not work together when vw, vh (why?)
     * vw and vh + border = scroll (unless max dimensions are set)
     * do not confuse vw and vh
     * after styling, make sure to include the element as well (define && declare!)
 [*] Image as an aside item
   [ ] Fix little pixel bottom gap (appeared apparently after image was fit inside container)
 [ ] Header styling
 [ ] Packing list items
  
  
##Projects in progress:
  - 100 blocks generator
  - Automated packing list
