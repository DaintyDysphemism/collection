# Collection

##Repository to-do:
 Front page:
 * (v/) Initial grid layout
   * Take-aways:
     * max-width and max-height do not work together when vw, vh (why?)
     * vw and vh + border = scroll (unless max dimensions are set)
     * do not confuse vw and vh
     * after styling, make sure to include the element as well (define && declare!)
 * (v/) Image as an aside item
   * Fix little pixel bottom gap (appeared apparently after image was fit inside container)
 * (v/) Header styling (still nitpicking the details)
   * (v/) Resolve inconsistency with Mac device (solved by importing both latin and latin ext- of the font, not just one)
 * Project items
